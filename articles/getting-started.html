<p>It is recommended that you use RStudio as your R <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> which can be downloaded for free from <a href="www.rstudio.com/download">this link</a>. dymium heavily relies on the <code>data.table</code> package for data operations and the <code>R6</code> package for creating and extending classes. It is recommended that you get yourself familiar with those two packages. However, it should be quite straight forward to see how they are being used in the getting started guide. So feel free to go on and read the rest of the guide! :) and also to let me know how I can improve this so that you can better understand <strong>dymium</strong>.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a quick start guide to build your first microsimulation model pipeline with <code>dymium</code>.</p>

<p>By install the <code>dymium</code> package it will automatically install other dymium packages such as <code>dymiumCore</code> and <code>dymiumGUI</code> as part of its dependencies. Basically, the <code>dymium</code> package act as a master package that when it is loaded it loads all other dymium packages, like the <code>tidyverse</code> package.</p>

<div id="build-your-world" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#build-your-world" class="anchor"></a>Build your world!</h2>
<p>In dymium, a ‘world’ object contains everything from representations of entities (eg: individuals, households, residential building, firms, and so on) to the rules (eg: probabilistic models, rates, exogenous variables, etc) that the entities of your world object follow.</p>
<p>Hence, to create your first dymium model you must first prepare your <code>world</code> and add your entities and rules that they will follow.<code>dymiumCore</code> provides four toy datasets which are individuals, households, residential buildings and zones. All of them are linkable by the id columns. All individuals belong to households, all households occupy residential buildings, all residential buildings are in the zones.</p>
<p>Let’s create a world object.</p>

<p><code>World$new()</code> is a [R6::R6Class] constructor, a constructor is a class method that creates an object of that class. So the line above creates a <code>World</code> object and assign it as <code>world</code> to your global environment. Now, your newly created world is still emptied. So we are going to add individuals into it using the <code>toy_individuals</code> dataset from <code>dymiumCore</code>.</p>

<p>You can see from the warning message above that <code>name</code> is not needed when adding an Entity class to <code>world</code> since it will use the name of the class as the name of the added object. However, when you add a model object the <code>name</code> argument must be specified. Currently, only one instance of each Entity class can be added to <code>world</code> since there is no obvious benefit to adding multiple instances of the same class to <code>world</code> since it is probably easier and clearer just to combine them as one instance.</p>
<p>Now that your <code>world</code> contains Individual agents we may want to introduce some rules so that we can start to microsimulate something!</p>
<p>Let’s microsimulate changes in marital status of the Individual agents.</p>
<p>Using <code>toy_individuals</code> as the data to estimate a marital status model with the <code>caret</code> package. By default, <code>caret</code> will fit a random forest model if the <code>method</code> argument in <code>train</code> is not specified.</p>
